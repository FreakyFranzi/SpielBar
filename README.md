# SpielBar
a gaming project for the nerd bar of the future where you can play with friends or make new friends by playing 
## Inspiration
A bar in Darmstadt with real games instead of electronic games
## What it does
Connects people in a bar with playing games via tablets which could be integrated in tables.
You can visit the locations in groups and play together like on a girlieâ€™s night but you can also visit the bar on your one and search for players. So by the way you meet new people have little challenges like the looser pays the next drink up to join an event like quiz night, singles playing or company playing events.
The service can be used by several locations so the people can play and connect worldwide and locations can competing. 
## How we built it
We use Android Studio to create a UI for tablets and to create a demo game to show possible use cases.
## Challenges we ran into
Building apps with Android Studio instead of Eclipse and build a technical concept to bring people together for playing games
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
New idea to bring people together in real life while playing online games
## What we learned
How to build apps with Android Studio and how to create a working UI which the user will like
## What's next for SpielBar
To create a fully functional prototype based on our concept to show our idea and to try it out.
